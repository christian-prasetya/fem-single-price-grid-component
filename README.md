Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

I started this challenge with the goals to learn more about CSS layouting, especially by using Grid system. It a bit challanging at first, with lots of googling and browsing through stack overflow, MDN, and W3C trying to find the right way to do Grid layout without any framework.

It finally did, I know it's not perfect, but here is this.

The key lesson I take from this challenge is, never afraid to apply your newly learned skill. There's a rainbow after the storm, all we need to do is passing through the storm head first.
